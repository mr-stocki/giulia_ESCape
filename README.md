## credit goes to:
* [original version](https://github.com/beaups/giulia_ESCape)
* [2.0T engine improvements](https://github.com/MageCoder/giulia_ESCape)
## notes
* this version is intended to be used with a different CAN-Bus shield (dfrobot DFR0370), so the pin numbers don't exactly match with the [original version](https://github.com/beaups/giulia_ESCape). take a look at the [connector details](connectors.md)
